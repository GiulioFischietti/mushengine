# MushEngine

A Flutter project for the Multimedia Information Retrieval and Computer Vision Project.
Requirements:
- Flutter v2.5.3
- Dart sdk: ">=2.11.0 <3.0.0" (without null-safety)

## Getting Started

The App functionalities are very basic and intended for educational purposes.
We start from the home screen, which allows us to select an image from the gallery or from
the camera.
We can upload an image and the app will classify the mushroom in one of the most common mushroom classes, showing also a list of similar mushrooms.
